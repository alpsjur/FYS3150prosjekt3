\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Starting with the methods section, I will shortly introduce some thermodynamic properties, before describing the Ising model and phase transitions in this model. I will then introduce the Metropolis' algorithm for solving the Ising model. Before the result section, a method for finding the probability distribution and the implementation of the algorithm is described. FLAGG om results FLAGG Finally, the results are discussed.
